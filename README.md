# Monet Style Transfer using GANs ðŸŽ¨

This project uses CycleGANs to transform real-world photos into Monet-style paintings. Developed as part of Week 5 in the Deep Learning course.

## Files
- `Week5_GAN.ipynb`: Full code notebook (Colab)
- `Week5Gan.pdf`: Report submission
- `images.zip`: Monet-style images for Kaggle submission
- `GAN-leaderboard.png`: Kaggle leaderboard screenshot

## Summary
CycleGAN was trained using the Kaggle competition dataset, learning to generate 256Ã—256 Monet-style images from real-world photos.

## Model
The generator is a ResNet-based encoder-decoder architecture with instance normalization and residual blocks.

## Results
Model achieved visually compelling Monet-style transfers and was successfully submitted to the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/).
